      <h1><b>OUR STORY</b></h1>
      <p>
		The story of Many Faces begins with Moses, the band’s guitarist, and Ben, the band’s bassist, who have been friends since childhood. Having played in several bands together over the years, they formed their first major project, Mindrive, a glam/alternative rock band.
		The band played countless shows, performing anywhere that would have them, but after facing internal conflicts with other band members, they decided to disband.
		Seeking a fresh perspective, Moses traveled to India for six months to clear his mind and contemplate his next steps. Upon returning to Israel, Moses felt the need to challenge himself abroad, and so he moved to the United States, where he lived in various cities for nearly four years. During his time in the U.S., he wrote a great deal of music, sharing his new songs with Ben through video calls. Even from afar, they discussed the idea of starting a new musical project together once Moses returned to Israel.
		When Moses finally came back to Israel, he and Ben started working on the material Moses had written while abroad, as they were talking about forming an Alternative Metal band. They began shaping the lyrics, building melodies, and developing full-fledged productions in their minds. Eventually, they conceptualized their debut album, Krifignos, which they are currently working on.
		The next step was to find the rest of the band. They first connected with Yuval, whose chemistry with the band was undeniable. After some time, the band began searching for a drummer, ultimately finding Eshchar, who became their drummer. However, due to personal reasons, both Yuval and Eshchar had to part ways with the band.
		Undeterred, Moses and Ben decided to continue working on the album in Moses’ studio, without a vocalist or drummer. Soon enough, the songs started to get a Progressive shape. After a long period of development and the completion of their track Infinity, the duo discovered Lior, the perfect match for their sound. From the moment they heard his voice, they knew he was the one. Lior quickly came on board, recording Infinity in a single take, cementing his place in the band.
		Today, Many Faces is hard at work on their debut album, Krifignos, and they are excited to share their music with the world, the album will be a Progressive/Alternative Metal album and will contain 11 songs.
